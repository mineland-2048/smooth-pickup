# Smooth Pickup

---

A small mod that frees the items from the pixel grid.

[Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/project/smooth-pickup)

This is specifically for big resolutions with big gui scales. The items and tooltips get fixed to the texture grid, which makes them a bit too jagged when moving slowly.

It was also made because I was annoyed with the jaggyness of items moving with controllify, so its compatible with it.
